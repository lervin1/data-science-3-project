## Memos

This subdirectory holds both of our progress memos (1 & 2) that were turned in to track our progress on our final project. The first progress memo establishes our prediction problem, dataset, and evaluation metric that will be used for the final project. It also outlines any potential issues with our dataset as well as the project as a whole. The second progress memo displays significant progress made towards the final project. We ran our Naive Bayes, Logistic, and Elastic Net models for evaluation.
