## Data

This is our folder with our data set. As a reminder our initial data set was removed from this foldeer due to the fact that it was over 1 GB in size even though this was the initial csv of the data set. We got the full baseball data set from the Chicago WhiteSox. 

The saved datasets are the downsampled data sets

## Directory Contents
