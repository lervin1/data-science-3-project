# Refined Models Stage

This subdirectory holds the models that we refined to try to increase our modelâ€™s performance. We changed our recipe slightly as well as redid our folds to 5 & 3. We tuned/fit additional Boosted Tree, Neural Network, and Random Forest models for model refinement. We assessed the models in the model analysis r-script and found that our boosted tree model was the best, but slightly worse than our initial boosted tree model.
