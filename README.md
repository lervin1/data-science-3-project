## Final Project

Our final project involves creating, refining, and fitting models to predict whether a batted ball was a base hit or not during 2023 MLB Games. The goal is to demonstrate the appropriate application of machine learning methods and practices to achieve the best prediction possible on the unknown testing dataset using a classification model.

Here is an overview of my directory.

The main repository houses all of the subdirectories and r-scripts that are necessary to complete this project. First, we have our data collection and data exploration r-scripts. The data collection r-script cleans up of the initial dataset. Furthermore, the data exploration r script contains a brief EDA for our target variable, `is_hit`.

### R Scripts

- `0a_data_collection.R`: Script for data collection
- `0b_data_exploration.R`: Script for initial data exploration

### Folders

- `data/`: Directory for data files
- `data-splits/`: Directory for data splits
- `figures/`: Directory for figures and visualizations
- `final-model/`: Directory for the final model files
- `initial-model-stage/`: Directory for initial model attempts
- `memos/`: Directory for memos and notes
- `recipes/`: Directory for preprocessing recipes
- `refined-model-stage/`: Directory for refined model attempts
