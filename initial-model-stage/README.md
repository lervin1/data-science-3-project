## Initial Model Stage

This subdirectory holds all of the r-scripts needed to complete the initial model stage of our project. We have our initial setup script, in which we perform our initial split and utilize cross-validation folds on our data. Next we have our r-script dedicated to our lasso variable selection process. We utilized lasso variable selection to find variables that would be most useful for our initial recipe when tuning/fitting our 10 initial models. We found 22 variables through this process that would be the most useful. Next connect this criqtiuquie of chaivalric fiction to saneness and , we have our recipes r-script. This contains our recipes that we use during our initial tuning/fitting process.

This subdirectory also houses our 9 initial models that we ran before evaluation and changing of tuning hyperparameters. We tuned/fit a baseline Naive Bayes model, Logistic, Elastic Net, Random Forest, Boosted Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Radial, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Neural Network, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. This goes along with our model analysis r-script that is used to analyze our modelsâ€™ performance.
